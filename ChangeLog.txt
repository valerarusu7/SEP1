Model:
- Added every missing "equals" method
- Added missing initializing in constructors
- Fixed comparing strings with "==" instead of aformentioned equals
- Tested equals methods 
- Removed endless loop in equals method by moving the "trainer" in Analysis to the Task
- Added IOExceptions to methods that can give problems with null objects so that they can be handled in Upperside
- Fixed logic in WorkerList, AnalysisList
- Added getters in WorkerList to accompany 'future' needs


ModelManager:
- Need to know what type of objects to throw at Controller, bare basics for now

FileManager:
- Format down, implementation at halt because of Model state
